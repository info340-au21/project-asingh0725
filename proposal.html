                        Mountain sports are well-loved but trip planning can be stressful due to treacherous weather, 
                        inadequate resort information, planning rentals and more. Skiing, snowboarding and hiking for 
                        example are highly dependent on safe weather and good conditions while also being very gear-
                        intensive.  When it comes to trip planning, weather information across multiple locations is 
                        imperative.  In order to obtain sufficient information on weather and mountain conditions, individuals 
                        currently need to go through numerous applications in order to find sufficient information for multiple locations.  
                        Furthermore, trip planning also includes elements such as rentals, resort information, drive times and availability. 
                        There are many existing sites that show weather and some that show trips but no sites cater to trip planning by 
                        including all relevant information on one site while also showing similar mountains or other trip options.

                        snow-forecast.com is an already existing web application that provides users with the weather conditions of 
                        resorts located all over the world. However, with our web app, we intend to make a one stop place for weather details, 
                        the activity details, details of the resort, as well as equipment rental options based on the activity the customer opts 
                        for. With our web app, we intend to reduce the number of different places a customer has to check when they plan for a 
                        mountain sport or activity.

                        Our web application’s aim is to be a central hub for students, tourists and families to find information before they plan 
                        their next outdoor adventure. With this web application, individuals will be able to find the best rentals, weather and 
                        mountain conditions, as well as leave reviews and “share” trips with others.  This addresses the critical need for comprehensive 
                        trip planning based on factual metrics and real-time data which will reduce user frustration and increase outdoor sports satisfaction.

                        For the project, we will be using several datatsets in the form of .csv files. One such dataset is about the

                    <p>Other datasets we will use will include weather information such as is found in the

                        In our web application, users will have access to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>real-time weather information based on their chosen activity and spot.</li>
                            <li>route planning and resort information.</li>
                            <li>equipment rental pricing.</li>
                            <li>activity wait times.</li>
                            <li>previous customer reviews as well as space to add their own reviews.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This will allow participants to better account for factors directly tied to outdoor enjoyment, giving them the ability
                        to effectively discern between trips before investing valuable time and money in the process.  During the process, users can make an 
                        account which stores their previous adventures and can also share experiences with other users.

                        Even though there are different apps for weather forecast, resorts booking, equipment rentals and user reviews nationally as well as 
                        globally, there are very few to no web apps that have an accumulation of all these features on one single website. With the help of 
                        our web app, we intend to provide customers with a one stop place for everything they need/need to know about the mountain sport/activity 
                        they intend to do in the state of Washington.
