The skiing wasn't that great either and the terrain Park was poorly done. I also felt very limited because I got yelled at for going off groomed trails, or going in the terrain Park but not going on any of the features. I was definitely underwhelmed by the skiing part and the people there were controlling, domineering, and mask nazis",

        "text": "They get less snow than just about every ski area in WA except the eastern wa places. Many years the lower mountain will be very bare until later in the season. Tickets have always been overpriced, and the parking has always been ridiculously lacking. Things are no different now than they were 25yrs ago, get there early or risk being turned away. In my opinion, WA has enough skiing to do where the snow is flying and don't worry about if it is a 'resort'. I have had some great days here, but probably more great days at seemingly lesser places like stevens, mission and the summit.",
